💡 Key Philosophy for DNA Evolution
Brand DNA should evolve from:

Static → Dynamic

Reactive → Predictive

Manual → Automated

Visual-only → Multi-sensory

Single-platform → Omni-channel

Human-created → AI-augmented

The ultimate goal: A living, breathing brand system that learns, adapts, and grows while maintaining core identity integrity.

show me  Project Structure after all this update
We are going to redesign the project structure to accommodate the new enhancements for Brand DNA.
The new structure will be more modular, scalable, and aligned with the advanced features we plan to add.

We will organize the project into a monorepo-like structure with clear separation of concerns:

web/: The main React/TypeScript frontend application

server/: Backend services (if needed, but currently we are using Supabase and serverless functions)

shared/: Shared types, utilities, and configurations between frontend and backend

extensions/: For plugins and integrations (like Figma, Adobe, etc.)

docs/: Comprehensive documentation

However, note that the current project is frontend-only and uses Supabase as the backend.
We are going to assume that we are adding some serverless functions (via Supabase Functions or similar) for advanced features.

Let's break down the new structure for the web application (frontend) and the new serverless functions.

Since the original project is a React app in web/, we will restructure the web/src to better accommodate the new features.

We are going to adopt a feature-based structure within web/src but with a more modular approach.

Proposed new structure for web/:

│   ├── shared/                  # Shared code across features

│   │   ├── components/         # Reusable UI components (Button, Input, etc.)

│   │   ├── constants/          # Application constants
│   │   └── types/              # Global TypeScript definitions
│   ├── services/               # External services (AI, storage, etc.)
│   │   ├── ai/                 # AI service with multiple providers

│   │   ├── design-tokens/      # Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
│   │   ├── themes/             # Theme definitions (dark, light)
│   │   └── global.css          # Global styles
│   └── main.tsx                # Application entry point
├── tests/                       # Test files (unit, integration, e2e)
├── docs/                        # Project documentation (user guides, API reference)
├── scripts/                     # Build and deployment scripts
├── .env                         # Environment variables
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts              # or webpack.config.js
Additionally, we will have a server/ directory for serverless functions (if we are using Supabase Functions, we might keep them in supabase/functions).

However, note that the original project uses Supabase and might not have a separate server. We are adding serverless functions for advanced AI processing, webhooks, etc.

Let's also consider the extensions/ directory for plugins:

text
extensions/
├── figma/                      # Figma plugin for Brand DNA sync
├── adobe/                      # Adobe Creative Cloud plugin
├── chrome/                     # Chrome extension for brand compliance checking
└── vscode/                     # VS Code extension for design token sync
And a shared/ directory for code shared between frontend, backend, and extensions:

text
shared/
├── types/                      # Shared TypeScript definitions
├── utils/                      # Shared utility functions
├── constants/                  # Shared constants
└── schemas/                    # Shared validation schemas (Zod, etc.)
Since the original project is a frontend-only app, we need to decide on the backend architecture.
We are using Supabase, so we can use Supabase Functions for serverless endpoints.

We can structure the Supabase functions in supabase/functions (if we are using Supabase) or create a server/ directory for a Node.js server if needed.

However, to keep it simple and aligned with Supabase, we will assume we are using Supabase Functions and keep them in supabase/functions.

Let's update the project structure to include:

text
supabase/
├── functions/                  # Supabase Edge Functions
│   ├── ai-processing/         # AI processing function
│   ├── webhooks/              # Webhook handlers
│   └── dna-analysis/          # DNA analysis function
├── migrations/                 # Database migrations
└── seed.sql                   # Seed data
Now, let's write the updated project structure in a clear way.

Since the original project only had a web/ directory, we are now adding shared/, extensions/, and supabase/.

However, note that the original project might not have a supabase/ directory because it uses a remote Supabase instance. We are adding it to manage migrations and functions.

Let's present the complete project structure after updates:

text
project-root/
├── web/                        # Frontend React application (as above)
├── shared/                     # Shared code between frontend, backend, and extensions
├── extensions/                 # Plugins for design tools and browsers
├── supabase/                   # Supabase project (if using self-hosted or for migrations)
│   ├── functions/              # Supabase Edge Functions
│   ├── migrations/             # Database migrations
│   └── seed.sql               # Seed data
├── docs/                       # Project documentation
├── scripts/                    # Build and deployment scripts
└── README.md
We are going to focus on the web/ structure since that is the main application.

Let me write the detailed structure for web/ again with the new enhancements in mind, particularly for Brand DNA.

We will break the features/brand-dna/ into subdirectories for each major enhancement:

text
web/src/features/brand-dna/
├── api/                        # Brand DNA API calls
├── components/                 # Brand DNA specific components
│   ├── DNAVisualizer/         # 3D DNA visualization
│   ├── DNAHistoryTimeline/    # DNA version history
│   ├── DNAComplianceScore/    # Compliance scoring component
│   └── DNAMutationEngine/     # DNA mutation and exploration
├── hooks/                     # Brand DNA specific hooks
│   ├── useDNAVersionHistory/
│   ├── useDNAMutation/
│   └── useDNACompliance/
├── types/                     # Brand DNA types
├── utils/                     # Brand DNA utilities
├── contexts/                  # Brand DNA contexts (if needed)
├── views/                     # Brand DNA views (pages)
│   ├── DNADashboard/          # Main DNA dashboard
│   ├── DNAVersionHistory/     # Version history view
│   ├── DNACompliance/         # Compliance dashboard
│   └── DNAExperimentation/    # DNA experimentation playground
└── index.ts                   # Public API for the feature
Similarly, we will update other features to be modular.

This structure is scalable and follows best practices for large React applications.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further adjustments.
