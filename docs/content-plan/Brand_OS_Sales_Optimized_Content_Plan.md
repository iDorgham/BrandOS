## 🎓 Content Voice & Tone

### Sales Writing Principles

**1. Lead with Pain**
- Start every section with the problem
- Quantify in $ and hours
- Make it visceral and relatable

**2. Quantify Everything**
- Never say "saves time"—say "saves 15 hours/week"
- Never say "affordable"—say "$49/month = 1 hour of agency time"
- Show ROI in specific timeframes: "Pays for itself in 11 days"

**3. Use Active Voice**
- ❌ "Inconsistent branding can be costly"
- ✅ "You're losing $4,200 every month"

**4. Address "You" Directly**
- ❌ "Brands experience consistency challenges"
- ✅ "Your brand looks different every time"

**5. Create Contrast**
- Before vs. After
- Manual vs. Automated
- Current cost vs. Brand OS cost

**6. Overcome Objections Proactively**
- "You might think it's expensive, but..."
- "Even if your team is small..."
- "Yes, you have guidelines—and they're being ignored"
