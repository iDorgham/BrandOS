## ❓ **Why Brand OS?**

Brand OS is the bridge between **static brand guidelines** and **intelligent asset generation**. Traditional brand manuals are "ignored PDFs"; Brand OS is a **living software layer** that:
- **Enforces Consistency**: RLS and Audit systems ensure no asset ever goes "off-brand."
- **Orchestrates Intelligence**: Use multiple AI models (Gemini, Claude, DALL-E) through a single brand-aware interface.
- **Reduces Overhead**: Automates the 80% of repetitive creative work, allowing directors to focus on the 20% of high-level strategy.

## 👥 **For Who?**

- **Art Directors**: To scale their vision across global teams without manual reviews.
- **Content Creators**: To generate high-fidelity, brand-aligned assets in seconds.
- **Enterprise CMOs**: To protect brand equity while adopting generative AI.
- **Design Systems Leads**: To extend the design system into the realm of AI-generated content.
