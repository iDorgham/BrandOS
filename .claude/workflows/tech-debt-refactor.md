1. **Analyze Bundle**: Use `fullstack-developer` to identify large dependencies and assets.
2. **Analyze Dependencies**: Use `devops-engineer` to check for unused or duplicate packages.
3. **Analyze Performance**: Use `qa-engineer` to find render bottlenecks and slow API calls.
4. **Identify Code Smells**: Audit code for complexity, duplication, and naming issues.
5. **Prioritize Refactors**: Use `product-planner` to create a high-impact optimization roadmap.
// turbo
6. **Remove Unused Deps**: Prune package.json and validate build integrity.
7. **Implement Lazy Loading**: Use `react-specialist` to apply dynamic imports to large components.
8. **Optimize Context**: Refactor React Context usage to reduce unnecessary re-renders.
9. **Refactor Duplicates**: Use `fullstack-developer` and `refactor-code` to DRY out the codebase.
// turbo
10. **Validate Build**: Run full build and test suite to ensure no regressions.
